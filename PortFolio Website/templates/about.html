    <p>Hi! I’m <b>Shaheer Mirza</b>, a <b>12-year-old programmer from Pakistan.</b> I love creating cool stuff with code — from building websites using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to writing Python scripts and making games in Roblox Studio.

I started coding at a young age, and ever since then, I’ve been exploring new technologies and challenging myself with new projects. Whether it's designing a personal website, automating tasks with Python, or scripting in Lua, I enjoy every part of the process.

This website is my space to share what I’ve built and learned. I'm always improving, always building, and always having fun with code!</p>
